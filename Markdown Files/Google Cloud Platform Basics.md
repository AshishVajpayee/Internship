# Google Cloud

**Google Cloud can be divided into four categories**
- Compute
- Storage
- Big Data
- AI/ML
<hr>

**Compute divided into four categories**
- Compute Engine
- Kubernetes Engine
- App Engine
- Cloud Functions

`Compute Engine` Compute Engines delivers configurable `virtual machines` running in Google's data centers.

`Kubernetes Engine` Google Kubernetes Engine`(GKE)` Runs containarized applications on a secured and managed Kubernetes service.

`App Engine` Google App Engine Build highly scalable applications on a fully managed serverless platform.  
- Application Engine where we can deploy web applications and large scale applications.

`Cloud Functions` Google Cloud Engine Runs light weight single functions.

**Storage has various categories**
- Cloud Bigtable
- Cloud Storage
- Cloud SQL
- Cloud Spanner
- Cloud Datastore

`Cloud Bigtable` Google Cloud Bigtable is a peta-byte scale, fully managed NoSQL database services for BIG DATA

`Cloud Storage` Google Cloud storage is a Object Storage for storing all kinds of objects files, images, videos, logs etc..

`Cloud SQL` Cloud SQL is a fully managed database service that makes it easy to set up, maintain, manage and administer your relational database on Google Cloud Platform.

**BIG DATA**
- BigQuery
- Cloud Pub/Sub
- Cloud Dataflow
- Cloud Data Catalog
